        After years of working as an Officer on Yachts I had a yearning for
        change. Taking courses on Udemy I started to teach myself Web
        Development. I was hooked! I started working on personal projects and
        decided to take my skills and knowledge a step forward do my formal
        studies to further progress my personal and professional goals.

        Having completed at BrainStation (Vancouver) just over a month ago I
        have taken up some new freelance work and continued to progress my
        skills wherever I can. I have just moved down to San Diego, CA and I can
        not wait to grow and progress my skills in Development both personally
        and professionally.
